# lunaparse.js
A parser generator of recursive descent parser for JavaScript.

## What is lunaparse?
lunaparse uses languages derived from PEG to describe grammars.\
With conventional parser generators, manually modifying automatically generated parsers was difficult.\
The recursive descent parsers generated by lunaparse can be easily modified later.\
lunaparse also provides an expression parser that can efficiently parse expressions. An expression parser based on Operator-precedence parser (Precedence Climbing) is generated.
