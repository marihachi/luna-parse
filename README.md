luna-parse is a parser generator.\
You can generate code by writing spec files.

luna-parse is influenced by the concept of PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar).\
However, it differs from PEG in that it does not perform backtracking.

The parsers generated by luna-parse are designed to be manually modifiable as needed.\
This is because it is difficult for a parser generator to fully generate real-world parsers.

I am currently developing it!

An example of spec file:
```
parser ExampleParser {
    root = topLevel (LF? topLevel)* ;
    topLevel = declareVar / show ;
    declareVar = VAR LF? IDENT LF? EQUAL LF? expr LF? SEMI ;
    show = SHOW LF? expr LF? SEMI ;
    term = NUMBER / IDENT ;
}

expression ExampleExpression {
    rule expr ;
    atom term ;
    operator group {
        infix operator ASTA ;
        infix operator SLASH ;
    }
    operator group {
        infix operator PLUS ;
        infix operator MINUS ;
    }
}

lexer ExampleLexer {
    [ignored] SPACE = " " ;
    [ignored] LF = "\r\n" / "\n" ;
    ASTA = "*" ;
    SLASH = "/" ;
    PLUS = "+" ;
    MINUS = "-" ;
    EQUAL = "=" ;
    SEMI = ";" ;
    SHOW = "show" ;
    VAR = "var" ;
    NUMBER = [1-9] [0-9]* ;
    IDENT = [a-zA-Z] ([a-zA-Z] / [0-9])* ;
}
```
Parser input:
```
var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 3;
show n1 * n2 + 1;
```

## Get started
1. Install
```
git clone https://github.com/marihachi/luna-parse.git
cd luna-parse
npm i
npm run build
```

2. Write a spec file of your parser

3. Generate a code of your parser
```
npm run generate
```

4. Enjoy your parser life!

## Why use luna-parse?
luna-parse uses languages derived from BNF to describe grammars.\
With traditional parser generators are generally not designed to make it easy to manually modify the generated parsers. Consequently, hand-writing parsers without using a parser generator was often easier to maintain.\
However, since luna-parse generates recursive descent parsers, they can be easily modified later.\
luna-parse also provides an expression parser that can efficiently parse expressions. An expression parser based on Operator-precedence parser (Precedence Climbing method) is generated.
