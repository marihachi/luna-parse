# luna-parse
[English](https://github.com/marihachi/luna-parse/blob/main/README.md) | [日本語](https://github.com/marihachi/luna-parse/blob/main/README.ja.md)

A code generator of recursive descent parser and lexer.

The parser generated by luna-parse follows a method known as LL parsing method.\
The input grammar must be a context-free grammar (CFG).

Under development!

An example of spec file:
```
config skipSpacing true

rule root = topLevel+
rule topLevel = declareVar | show
rule declareVar = "var" name "=" expr ";"
rule show = "show" expr ";"
rule term = DIGIT+ | ident
rule ident = ALPHA (ALPHA | DIGIT)*

expression expr {
    atom term
    operator group {
        infix operator "*"
        infix operator "/"
    }
    operator group {
        infix operator "+"
        infix operator "-"
    }
}
```
Parser input:
```
var n1 = 2;
var n2 = 3;
show n1 * n2 + 1;
```

## Get started
1. Install
```
git clone https://github.com/marihachi/luna-parse.git
cd luna-parse
npm i
npm run build
```

2. Write a spec file of your parser

3. Generate a code of your parser
```
npm run generate
```

4. Enjoy your parser life!

## Why use luna-parse?
luna-parse uses languages derived from BNF to describe grammars.\
With traditional parser generators are generally not designed to make it easy to manually modify the generated parsers. Consequently, hand-writing parsers without using a parser generator was often easier to maintain.\
However, since luna-parse generates recursive descent parsers, they can be easily modified later.\
luna-parse also provides an expression parser that can efficiently parse expressions. An expression parser based on Operator-precedence parser (Precedence Climbing method) is generated.
